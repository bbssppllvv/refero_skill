# Anti-AI-Slop Manifesto

**CRITICAL: Your design must NOT look AI-generated.**

AI-generated interfaces converge on the same tired patterns because they optimize for "safe" and "average." Real designers make intentional, contextual choices.

## 🚨 THE SINGLE BIGGEST AI TELL: INDIGO/VIOLET

**If you remember nothing else from this guide, remember this:**

Every AI model defaults to indigo/violet (`#6366f1`, `#8b5cf6`, `#7c3aed`). It's become the universal fingerprint of "this was generated by AI."

**Why it happens:**
- Training data includes millions of examples using Tailwind's indigo
- Purple is perceived as "modern" and "safe"
- LLMs optimize for the average, and indigo IS the average

**The rule:** 
> **NEVER use indigo/violet unless the brand explicitly requires it.**

If someone asks "why purple?" and your answer is "it looked nice" or "I don't know"—you've failed. Change the color.

**Quick alternatives:**
| Instead of | Try | Feeling |
|------------|-----|---------|
| Indigo `#6366f1` | Blue `#2563eb` | Trust, professional |
| Violet `#8b5cf6` | Teal `#0d9488` | Fresh, distinctive |
| Purple `#7c3aed` | Brand color | Authentic, intentional |

## What Makes Design Look Generic

**Typography symptoms:**
- ❌ Using the same font as every other AI-generated site
- ❌ Same weight throughout (no hierarchy)
- ❌ Default system fonts without intention
- ❌ No distinction between display and body text
- ❌ **Missing letter-spacing** (especially on ALL CAPS and small text)

**Color symptoms:**
- ❌ **Default indigo/violet** (#1 indicator)
- ❌ Gradients that don't serve function
- ❌ Perfectly even color distribution
- ❌ Colors chosen for "safety" not meaning
- ❌ No clear accent hierarchy

**Layout symptoms:**
- ❌ Perfectly symmetrical everything
- ❌ Cookie-cutter card grids
- ❌ Hero with left text + right image (every landing page ever)
- ❌ Centered everything with no visual tension

**Visual symptoms:**
- ❌ Abstract blob backgrounds (no meaning)
- ❌ Generic 3D illustrations
- ❌ Effects without purpose
- ❌ Stock imagery that could be anywhere

## The Antidote: Intentional Design

**Typography with purpose:**
- ✅ Choose fonts that **match your tone** from references
- ✅ Create **clear hierarchy** (3-4 distinct levels)
- ✅ Use **weight and spacing** to differentiate, not just size
- ✅ Study what fonts **successful apps in your space** use

**Color with meaning:**
- ✅ Build palette **from your references**
- ✅ Use **dominant + sharp accent** (not evenly distributed)
- ✅ Make semantic colors **actually semantic**
- ✅ Consider **dark mode from the start**

**Layout with intention:**
- ✅ Create **visual tension** through asymmetry
- ✅ Use **whitespace as a design element**
- ✅ Break the grid **intentionally** (one element, not everything)
- ✅ Guide the eye with **clear visual hierarchy**

**Details that distinguish:**
- ✅ Custom illustrations or **real photography**
- ✅ Micro-interactions that **reinforce brand**
- ✅ Shadows and depth **when they serve hierarchy**
- ✅ One memorable detail users will **actually remember**

## The AI Slop Detector Checklist

```
□ Is the accent color NOT indigo/violet? (instant fail if unjustified)
□ Does ALL CAPS text have letter-spacing?
□ Would this pass the "screenshot test" next to references?
□ Are font choices intentional and contextual?
□ Are colors derived from research, not defaults?
□ Does the layout have visual interest and tension?
□ Are there any generic patterns you can't justify?
□ Could you explain WHY each design choice was made?
```

## Experiment vs. Safe

**"Best practices" can be a trap.**

AI models default to the most common patterns because they're trained on averages. But the most memorable designs often break conventions intentionally.

**Safe (forgettable):**
- 3-column pricing grid because "everyone does it"
- Hero with left text + right image because "it works"
- Card grid with equal spacing because "it's clean"

**Intentional (memorable):**
- 2-column pricing because your product only has 2 tiers
- Full-width hero image with overlay because it fits the brand
- Asymmetrical layout because you want visual tension

**The difference:** Can you justify the choice? If yes—do it. If no—question it.

> "I chose this because [specific reason for THIS project]" beats "I chose this because everyone does it."
